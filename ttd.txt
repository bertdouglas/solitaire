figure out how to comply with cargo conventions for crate with both bin
and library, so that I don't have to use paths to reference modules in
examples.

get rid of un-needed crates added

track down some bit hack references

Figure out if the high speed of shuffle is real or if the bulk of code
has been optimized away, because results are not being used.

test random numbers are really random
check deck shuffle is really random

move deck object to separate file.  Looks like I am headed towards
one object, one file.  Harder to share stuff between objects.
Easier than scrolling up and down in a huge file.

benchmark deck::new() and other similar functions to make sure the
compiler has optimized them into tables.

----------------------------
benchmark the random number generator for time
  also for runs test.  The range 0..2 on integers may not be well tested

statistics with runs increasing and decreasing according to NIST docs.

benchmark the shuffle function.  A lot of testing is needed.
So it needs to be fast.

function to print a deck in unicode.
can unicode be displayed on console, can font be added to console.

Make a pretty print function for cards.  Possibly with colors.

experiment with functions that merely initialize a table.
See how complicated it can get and still be done at compile time.
