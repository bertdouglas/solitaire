Decide to proceed with loading of xml file saved gamestate from
the kpat program.  This will be needed to compare play with a known
working solitaire program.  Seems simple enough xml.

After reading about xml handling, I have picked strong-xml for first
attempt.

Now see after several moves the meaning of the xml file.  It is a
sequence of states.  Each state encodes a sequence of moves of single
cards.  It specifies the target pile and position (which always seems
to be the last card.) , and the source card by suit and rank.  A weird
mixture of location and value nomenclature.  The big point is that the
moves are incremental, so to get the final state you must apply each
move in turn.  This is ok for simple undo and redo, but for going
back to a saved position it would be awkward.  And for an automated
solver, with many unexplored positions, it would be slow and awkard.
I am happy that my full-state approach seems better, and takes less
only 104 bytes per state, which is less than the xml takes.  They
probably have a more compact in memory representation.

Most computers have gigabytes of memory space.  A million states
would take about 100 megabytes, which is not a problem.  Is it
possible to have a million states in a solitaire game?

Practically speaking, the layout would have to be in memory twice. Once
in a hash table as a key, to allow quick finding of position, if you
happened to arrive at the same layout through a different path. Then
there would have to be a table of the layouts in order visited by
index, to allow finding previous positions, and multiway branching.

I have a feeling that, while there may be more positions in a typical
game than you can explore by hand, there are not enough to fill memory.

Wow !  Just two and a half hours to read a bunch of examples and figure
out the patterns.  It worked the first time that it compiled.
Very good luck with yaserde.  Glad I dropped strong-xml right away.
All the attributes looked way too complicated.

Even the default for the missing "current" attribute worked.
Compare the two files side by side.
Do not see any problems.

File size of pretty print output with lots of indenting and wasted
spacing is 18kB.  The xml file is 5kB.  But it is in rust and can
iterate over it.

What next?  Define a game state structure and file format? Do I know
enough to do that already?  Should I look for another open source
solitaire with save feature?

Tried the raw parts scheme.  Only way I could get it to compile is to
use a CardVec constructor, and from execution times, that causes
a copy of the whole vector.
Conclude that the example does not apply to my case.  It is changing
a vector of i32 to u32.

        impl CardVec {
        pub fn from_vec_u8(v:Vec<u8>) -> CardVec {
            use raw_parts::RawParts;
            let RawParts { ptr, length, capacity } = RawParts::from_vec(v);
            unsafe {
                let ptr = ptr as *mut Card;
                CardVec { cards: RawParts::into_vec(
                    RawParts { ptr, length, capacity }
                ) }
            }
        }}

This is from the raw-parts crate.  Look for another example.
No matching examples.
Looks like I need to use bare vectors without struct wrapper.
Then do not need raw parts.

Recoded to use Vec<Card> and Vec<u8>
Failed to optimize one way.  Ok the other.

      pub fn vec_u8_from_vec_card(vec_card:Vec<Card>) -> Vec<u8> {
          vec_card.into_iter()
              .map(|x| x.code)
              .collect()
      }

      pub fn vec_card_from_vec_u8(vec_u8:Vec<u8>) -> Vec<Card> {
          vec_u8.into_iter()
              .map(|x| Card{code:x})
              .collect()
      }

First one optimizes out the copy.  Second does not.
    vector sizes :  [100, 10000, 1000000]
    to_u8 times  :  [6.4e-8, 3.8e-8, 4.9e-8]
    from_u8 times:  [4.4e-7, 3.2280000000000003e-6, 0.00047802]

Looks like it is necessary to use the raw parts trick after all.

Recoded using raw parts.

    pub fn vec_card_from_vec_u8(vec_u8:Vec<u8>) -> Vec<Card> {
        use raw_parts::RawParts;
        let RawParts { ptr, length, capacity } = RawParts::from_vec(vec_u8);
        unsafe {
            let ptr = ptr as *mut Card;
            RawParts::into_vec( RawParts { ptr, length, capacity })
        }
    }

It is still slow.  Look at test again.  Make sure test is right.
Found mistakes in test.  The from and to were backwards.
And one side had a clone() operation inside the time capture.

Spent a lot of time doing nice formatting of floatin point numbers.
There is no built in support that is any good.  You have to get a
crate to do it.  There are quite a few.  Not clear which one is best.
Output now much more readable.

Getting good numbers for both the idiom and the raw parts version.
There is enough noise in measurements that it is not clear which one
is faster.  Would be hard to add iterations, because clone would be
needed, as input is consumed.

Call it good enough.
----------------------------------
Came back later and did several more commits.

Did a search for file formats used by other implementations of solitaire
to save their games.  The very nice c code in gnome aisleriot does not
have a game save feature.
However the "kpat" package from KDE does have a game save feature.
The file is xml.  Verbose.  A lot obvious.  Some unclear.
Looks promising for reverse engineering.
One thing is clear is that it saves a single game position, not the
entire game history.

There is also a microsoft solitaire file save format.
But could not find any details about format.

The pile named "talon" is the stock.  Last in list is the top card.

The piles "play0" through "play6" are the tableau in order from left
to right.  The face down cards are listed separately from the face up
cards, even though each card is tagged as to face up or face down.

There is no output for the empty foundation spaces.

Card ids are a mystery.  Very long, very random numbers.  Must be a lot
of different cards, or else each possible overlap has a different id.
Or maybe it is a hash key.  Fortunately they are not needed as the
suit and rank are listed in plain obvious text.

Need a file format to hold history and all game state
allow backtracking and keep all the paths traveled

  vector of positions
    pos id, prev pos id, layout in compact text, move?, no branches

  name of game
  names of piles
  current position by id
  list of marked positions
  deck after shuffling

I think it works better to put the suit first and rank second.
Fewer options for collisions in letters.

CHDS and P

other letters JQKA  no conflicts
use T for ten, still no conflict

P0P0P5C1CAH3D7SA

And for face down cards use lower case

P0P0P9c1cAh3d7SA
P0 P0 P5 c1 cA h3 d7 SA
p0 p0 p5 c1 cA h3 d7 SA
p0 p0 p5 c1 ca h3 d7 SA

p0 p0 p5c1cah3d7SA p3c5h7D3

should P be upper or lower
Doesn't matter, which is easier to read

should jqka be lower as well when card is face down?

Could put each pile in a separate string.  List of strings.



Could put in spaces for ease of reading.  But nobody is going to read this.
And it just takes 50% more space.

I see in the glossary of patience terms that talon is another name for
stock.

Decided to make a new struct CardVec and hang some methods on it to
convert to and from other types like Vec<u8>.
For making tests, it is awkward and overly cluttered to initialize a vector of Cards.

Problem is there is no good way in rust to change the type of a vector
even if the underlying types both have size of one byte.

If you use idiomatic iterators with NoOp map function, then supposedly
the copy is optimized away.  Having trouble properly constructing
the iterator from Vec<u8> back to Vec<Card>.  Maybe I am doing it wrong.
Or maybe it is impossible without writing a custom Fromiterator function.

There is also a feature in "nightly" that converts a vector into "raw parts"
which can then be used to make a new vector.

    #![feature(vec_into_raw_parts)]

    fn convert_using_into_raw_parts(v: Vec<T>) -> Vec<U> {
        let (ptr, len, cap) = v.into_raw_parts();
        unsafe { Vec::from_raw_parts(ptr as *mut U, len, cap) }
    }

There is also a crate that does something similar.  Uses a regular
struct instead of a tuple struct.  Impossible to get fields in wrong order.
And don't have to use nightly rust.

      use raw_parts::RawParts;

      let v: Vec<i32> = vec![-1, 0, 1];

      let RawParts { ptr, length, capacity } = RawParts::from_vec(v);

      let rebuilt = unsafe {
          // We can now make changes to the components, such as
          // transmuting the raw pointer to a compatible type.
          let ptr = ptr as *mut u32;
          let raw_parts = RawParts { ptr, length, capacity };

          RawParts::into_vec(raw_parts)
      };
      assert_eq!(rebuilt, [4294967295, 0, 1]);

-----------------------------
Back at night.  Got the iterator version working.  Wrote a timing test
to see how it is optimized.

    bertd@ghd-asb:~/0repos/solitaire$ cargo run -r --example test_card_vec
       Compiling solitaire v0.1.0 (/home/bertd/0repos/solitaire)
        Finished release [optimized] target(s) in 0.38s
         Running `target/release/examples/test_card_vec`
    vector sizes :  [100, 10000, 1000000]
    to_u8 times  :  [5.9000000000000006e-8, 3.7e-8, 5.5e-8]
    from_u8 times:  [4.3400000000000005e-7, 2.889e-6, 0.00044496700000000005]

to_u8 takes same time even on large vector.
from_u8 takes 100 times longer on long vector.
It is even 10 times longer on short vector.

Looks like I need to go to the raw parts method.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
2023-04-30 Sunday

Found that there are unicode characters in standard linux
console fond that represent card suits. Sadly they are almost
too small to see.  The codes are u2660 to u2667.

    println!("\u{2660} \u{2661} \u{2662} \u{2663} ");
    println!("\u{2664} \u{2665} \u{2666} \u{2667} ");

    ♠ ♡ ♢ ♣
    ♤ ♥ ♦ ♧

It looks like the solid black ones would be most useful.
Still I wonder if using a single letter abbreviation might be easier
to read.  SHDC  ♠♥♦♣

It is possible to increase font size on console.  But this makes it
fill the screen, and also makes regular letters bigger as well.

I wonder about color.

    use colored::Colorize;
    println!("{}","\u{2660} \u{2661} \u{2662} \u{2663} ".red().on_white() );
    println!("{}","\u{2664} \u{2665} \u{2666} \u{2667} ".red().on_white() );
    println!("{}","\u{2660} \u{2661} \u{2662} \u{2663} ".black().on_white() );
    println!("{}","\u{2664} \u{2665} \u{2666} \u{2667} ".black().on_white() );

This works. Although the white is not really white.  More like a light grey.

I want to make a simple display that is functional, but not
skeuomorphic like the usual solitaire games. No overlapping cards. I
just want to get working display as easy as possible, and generic as
possible.

Decide to still with plain text, no special characters.
Experiment more with color.

Well the 8 traditional colors are not right.
Use so called truecolor rgb instead.  At least with the "colored" crate.

Not sure how much abbreviation is appropriate.
What is the maximum number of solitaire cards in a pile or group?
in the Tableau, 13 cards k through a
Same in the foundation

Initial deal has 7 piles in the tableau with 1 through 7 cards
so the sum is 7*8/2 = 28
So the stock pile has initially 52 - 28 = 24 cards
So that is the biggest pile initially
If all are displayed, using 3 characters each, it takes 96 columns.
Doable.

How many piles total, stock, waste, f1 to f4 t1 to t7
2+4+7 = 13
The waste does not need to be displayed, so only 12
There are usually 24 lines, should be enough
Many piles, as in tableau will have to be adjacent

I am thinking about horizontal piles, turned 90 degrees normal.
Right to left, instead of top down.  This could be done without
any heavy duty console engine.

Try 2460 block of unicode in console.\
Works.

installed a rust solitaire game from
https://github.com/florimondmanca/solitaire-rs

No docs.  figured out some.  Seems incomplete. Used a
cursor that points to a pile.  Space bar selects.  Then move cursor, then
hit space again.  Enter key moves ace to foundation.
Can't figure out how to get next card from stock.
Some definite bugs.  Cursor disappears when it is on the selected pile.
But it is a good demo of how to do vertical layout on console.
Now obvious that anything without drag and drop is going to be a pain.
The suit symbols were readable.

Look more at speed.  Is it reasonable.
Assume 1 microsecond per shuffle.
52 cards
1 instruction per nanosecond
that is 1000/52 = 19 instructions per card
Does not seem reasonable.

Take a look at assembly code.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
2023-04-25 Tuesday

Worked last night.  Did not make any logs.

Today got shuffle test going.
Added timestamps to determine shuffle rate.
It is coming back as 1.5 million/second.
It is hard to see how you can even get 52 random numbers in less
than a microsecond.

So far everything seems to be working correctly as soon as compiler
bugs are removed.  Hard to believe.

Need to check that work is actually being done.
Perhaps try some of the benchmark features of rust.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
2023-04-23 Sunday

Yesterday worked all day and half the night.
But not much got logged.

Rewrote nearly all of the deck module.
Using closures for array of struct initialization.
Trying to meet two opposing goals.
  - pretty code that has all info together one place easy to read
  - efficient to access with u8 and [u8;n]
The initializer syntax in rust is weak.  Ask around and they say
"use a macro".  Well I am not ready for that yet.
Also rust, unlike c, will not convert between integer types automatically.
If you use a neat quoted string, which is easy to read, then you have
a type &str, which takes a lot of clutter to convert to [u8;n]
If you code the source as ["a","b","c"] then the code is harder to read
and you get long lines, or folded lines

Right now I have neat source initializers and compact targert but
a whole lot of code to convert one to the other.

Had a nice experience with the iterator and any()
It seems like things just work with iterators.
That part of the compiler is more polished.

Try to convert some more code to iterators.

Got one success right away.  With compiler hint, learned about
try_into(), which solves one problem I was having last night.

Learned that there are two kinds of asserts.
regular assert is always compiled in both for debug and release
debug_assert is elided in release mode and only present in debug mode

discovered that my way of converting &str to &[u8] requires
them to both be the same size.
  "abc".as_bytes().try_into().unwrap()

So what to do?
  keep in the struct
  convert to string stored elsewhere, with ref
  pad with spaces and access with trim()
  probably would be going against convention to put zero terminator
  try to make a slice that refers to buffer in same struct

Not working

      error[E0204]: the trait `Copy` may not be implemented for this type
        --> src/deck.rs:60:17
         |
      60 | #[derive(Clone, Copy, Debug, Default)]
         |                 ^^^^
      ...
      65 |     repr1  : [u8],  // these slices point to buffer in struct
         |     ------------- this field does not implement `Copy`

Obviously I don't understand what is happening with slices.
Is a slice simply a sequence of bytes?
Or is it a pointer and length referring to a sequence of bytes

I am tangled up in something too complicated.  The Lazy init requires
constructing a copy of the needed data structure, which is then returned
from the closure and copied into the static array of structs.

Too many macros.  Hard to understand or debug.  Probably some corner
cases in them not handled correctly.  Too much magic.  Get rid of Once
Cell.  With a little bit of code can do my own init, instead of trying
to hide it and make it fancy.

Here we go again.  Not sure I am converging.  But the key to performance
is compact tables.  This is good for cache.  With all the strings and slices
and references the data must be spread out.

Well, hit a brick wall here as well.  Static have all sorts of restrictions
and mutable statics are worse.

    error[E0015]: cannot call non-const fn `<RankInfo as Default>::default` in statics
      --> src/deck.rs:67:35
       |
    67 | static RANK_INFO_BLANK:RankInfo = Default::default();

      --> src/deck.rs:67:35
       |
    67 | static RANK_INFO_BLANK:RankInfo = Default::default();

I think that I am beginning to get the message.  Forget about statics.

One more time.  Make a function that constructs the rankinfo
and returns a reference.  Hope the compiler optimizes it.

Ok.  That worked ok. Can't return a reference.  That leaves ownership
inside the function.  But returning the whole thing works. Obviously I
don't fully understand it. Not many problems.  Good stuff with the fstr
type strings.  Had to get rid of derive Default on the RankInfo.  But
it was not needed in new scheme, as constructing each value and then
pushing to a vector.

Built for release and looked for the function.  It was not there.
Looked in main.  All inlined.  Less than one screen of code, all of
it doing the test function.

how can compiler be this smart?

So I got it cache friendly, all in code section in immutable table,
and easy to read.  Success.

There is problem with the rank_next() concept.  The rule for testing
for next is broken at the unused card, the knight.  Maybe should
just get rid of the unused cards.  Too tired to do it now.
Still have to rewrite the rest of the init.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
2023-04-22 Saturday

Thinking ahead to what will be needed.
Ability to display a card.
Standard abbreviations for debug display

Testing if a card is red or black.
Seeing how good the inlining is, I think it best to provide a method
for this, even if it is a trivial method.  Hide the masks from the api.

ability to manipulate game states, and move cards from one pile to
another.

Dealing with game states seems sufficiently large and different
so that it should be a separate module from the "deck" module.

perhaps deck is not the best name.  Maybe "card" would be better.

Do we really need the ordinal deck?  It was as a bridge to faster
shuffle, by shuffling the ordinals, then looking up the bitcode.
Extra lookup seems to take enough time to overcome any speed of
working with ordinals.

For today, continue and do more unit tests and get rid of some of
the unused code warnings.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
2023-04-21 Friday

Changed a lot of init to lazy static.
They ran into a problem that could not be fixed.
Latest version of compiler now recommends
"once_cell::Lazy"
So I converted all the lazy inits.
Also moved most of code to new module called "deck".
Changed the main deck to a regular struck.  Got rid of the type state
attempt.
Still need to convert some functions to be methods of struct Deck.
Change args to shuffle.  Put the call to get random bits inside of
shuffle.  Why did I do this?  Oh.  It was to allow comparison of two
different shuffle functions, one obvious simple code, and the other
intricate index manipulation.

It compiles and runs
but does little so far.  I like the closure, which avoids having to make
a special one use named function as with lazy static.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
2023-04-20 Thursday

Found that cargo-asm is abandoned.
Instead there is new project called cargo-show-asm which
does roughly same thing but better and active.
Give it a try.
cargo uninstall cargo-asm
cargo install cargo-show-asm
cargo asm shuffle_main

It worked.  Nice colors.  No source code to speak of.
Much less junk than raw .s file.
more references have meaningful names, all library functions, like alloc, panic
Function is completely inlined.

rustup component add rust-src
cargo asm --rust  solitaire::main > main.asm

now getting more source code.
The entirety of make_ordinals reduced to a sequence of moves inlined in main.
But the source code refers only to one line in the middle of make ordinals.
Most helpfully the reference includes the line number.
Ovbiously there is a table somewhere.  Why not reference it directly
instead of doing moves.
Not impressed with type states.  Seems to get in the way.
See if I can convert make ordinals so it is handled completely at compile time.
Perhaps take another look at lazy static.

		// /home/bertd/0repos/solitaire/src/main.rs : 216
		out.0[i] = i as u8;
	movaps xmm0, xmmword ptr [rip + .LCPI24_0]
	movaps xmmword ptr [rsp + 224], xmm0

	movaps xmm0, xmmword ptr [rip + .LCPI24_1]
	movaps xmmword ptr [rsp + 240], xmm0

	movaps xmm0, xmmword ptr [rip + .LCPI24_2]
	movaps xmmword ptr [rsp + 256], xmm0

	mov dword ptr [rsp + 272], 858927408

This is moving 52 bytes.  Using xmm registers it loads and stores
16 bytes, three times, moving 48 bytes.  Then it moves 4 additional
bytes from an immediate source, making 52 in all.

.LCPI24_0:
	.byte	0
	.byte	1
	.byte	2
	.byte	3
	.byte	4
	.byte	5
	.byte	6
	.byte	7
	.byte	8
	.byte	9
	.byte	10
	.byte	11
	.byte	12
	.byte	13
	.byte	14
	.byte	15

This is amazing optimization.  With a little more hint, it should be
able to get rid of the move.

Decide to rewrite out a deck object, with variant forms.
Start coding.  Improve a bunch of names.
Use lots of lazy static, whenever possible.

Have to stop.  Half complete.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
2023-04-18 Tuesday
Learning to look at assembly language
follow advice on web.

      RUSTFLAGS="--emit asm" cargo bench --bench foo

      cargo asm --asm-style=intel \
         --rust equart::quadtree::Boundry::subarea

      cargo asm --rust crate::klondike_suits

Could not find any relevant output in release mode.
But this gave some results.  Strange looking assembly.

      RUSTFLAGS="--emit asm" cargo clean
      RUSTFLAGS="--emit asm" cargo build

In the debug directory found this searching for klondike.

                .section	.text._ZN9solitaire14klondike_suits17h318c732eb4fa0095E,"ax",@progbits

                .cfi_endproc

So it appears, indeed, that the function was optimized away into a
table built at compile time.  I wonder how complicated the code can get and
still run at compile time.  At run time it is merely a single load
effective address instruction and return.

In the release version, this function goes away completely and it is inlined.
Got to be a better way to find the code and read it.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
2023-04-17 Monday

I timed the shuffle test.  User time is:   2m38.310s
1e7 calls to shuffle and to get random bits
ghci> ((2*60)+38.31)/1e7
1.5831e-5

That is surprisingly fast.
About 16 microseconds per iteration.  And each iteration
handles 52 items.  How can it be that fast?
At 2GHZ that is 32k cycles.  That is the top down.
Bottom up guess, (52*2*10) 1040 instructions
That leaves in middle 32 clocks per instruction.
Seem high.  Perhaps more like 4 to 10.

Wonder if the bulk is in random number generation or in the shuffle.
Investigate if possible to get a vector of numbers in a single call
to random number generator.

Coded a test function for shuffle.  Made a deck in sequence, ordinals.
Shuffled 10 times.  Inserted into a hash table.  Repeat a million
times. Ran several times.  No duplicates found. Look at some of
shuffles.  Looks normal.  So this looks like a good shuffle function.

Found that if you want to see console output of successful tests, then
you must add this flag.  I think that the console output of failing
tests is displayed. I guess normally you don't care about output from
passing tests, and there are probably a lot of tests, and it would get
cluttered.

    cargo test -- --nocapture
