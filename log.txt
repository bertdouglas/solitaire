Coded a test function for shuffle.  Made a deck in sequence, ordinals.
Shuffled 10 times.  Inserted into a hash table.  Repeat a million
times. Ran several times.  No duplicates found. Look at some of
shuffles.  Looks normal.  So this looks like a good shuffle function.

Found that if you want to see console output of successful tests, then
you must add this flag.  I think that the console output of failing
tests is displayed. I guess normally you don't care about output from
passing tests, and there are probably a lot of tests, and it would get
cluttered.

    cargo test -- --nocapture
