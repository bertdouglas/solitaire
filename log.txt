Yesterday worked all day and half the night.
But not much got logged.

Rewrote nearly all of the deck module.
Using closures for array of struct initialization.
Trying to meet two opposing goals.
  - pretty code that has all info together one place easy to read
  - efficient to access with u8 and [u8;n]
The initializer syntax in rust is weak.  Ask around and they say
"use a macro".  Well I am not ready for that yet.
Also rust, unlike c, will not convert between integer types automatically.
If you use a neat quoted string, which is easy to read, then you have
a type &str, which takes a lot of clutter to convert to [u8;n]
If you code the source as ["a","b","c"] then the code is harder to read
and you get long lines, or folded lines

Right now I have neat source initializers and compact targert but
a whole lot of code to convert one to the other.

Had a nice experience with the iterator and any()
It seems like things just work with iterators.
That part of the compiler is more polished.

Try to convert some more code to iterators.

Thinking ahead to what will be needed.
Ability to display a card.
Standard abbreviations for debug display

Testing if a card is red or black.
Seeing how good the inlining is, I think it best to provide a method
for this, even if it is a trivial method.  Hide the masks from the api.

ability to manipulate game states, and move cards from one pile to
another.

Dealing with game states seems sufficiently large and different
so that it should be a separate module from the "deck" module.

perhaps deck is not the best name.  Maybe "card" would be better.

Do we really need the ordinal deck?  It was as a bridge to faster
shuffle, by shuffling the ordinals, then looking up the bitcode.
Extra lookup seems to take enough time to overcome any speed of
working with ordinals.

For today, continue and do more unit tests and get rid of some of
the unused code warnings.

Changed a lot of init to lazy static.
They ran into a problem that could not be fixed.
Latest version of compiler now recommends
"once_cell::Lazy"
So I converted all the lazy inits.
Also moved most of code to new module called "deck".
Changed the main deck to a regular struck.  Got rid of the type state
attempt.
Still need to convert some functions to be methods of struct Deck.
Change args to shuffle.  Put the call to get random bits inside of
shuffle.  Why did I do this?  Oh.  It was to allow comparison of two
different shuffle functions, one obvious simple code, and the other
intricate index manipulation.

It compiles and runs
but does little so far.  I like the closure, which avoids having to make
a special one use named function as with lazy static.

Found that cargo-asm is abandoned.
Instead there is new project called cargo-show-asm which
does roughly same thing but better and active.
Give it a try.
cargo uninstall cargo-asm
cargo install cargo-show-asm
cargo asm shuffle_main

It worked.  Nice colors.  No source code to speak of.
Much less junk than raw .s file.
more references have meaningful names, all library functions, like alloc, panic
Function is completely inlined.

rustup component add rust-src
cargo asm --rust  solitaire::main > main.asm

now getting more source code.
The entirety of make_ordinals reduced to a sequence of moves inlined in main.
But the source code refers only to one line in the middle of make ordinals.
Most helpfully the reference includes the line number.
Ovbiously there is a table somewhere.  Why not reference it directly
instead of doing moves.
Not impressed with type states.  Seems to get in the way.
See if I can convert make ordinals so it is handled completely at compile time.
Perhaps take another look at lazy static.

		// /home/bertd/0repos/solitaire/src/main.rs : 216
		out.0[i] = i as u8;
	movaps xmm0, xmmword ptr [rip + .LCPI24_0]
	movaps xmmword ptr [rsp + 224], xmm0

	movaps xmm0, xmmword ptr [rip + .LCPI24_1]
	movaps xmmword ptr [rsp + 240], xmm0

	movaps xmm0, xmmword ptr [rip + .LCPI24_2]
	movaps xmmword ptr [rsp + 256], xmm0

	mov dword ptr [rsp + 272], 858927408

This is moving 52 bytes.  Using xmm registers it loads and stores
16 bytes, three times, moving 48 bytes.  Then it moves 4 additional
bytes from an immediate source, making 52 in all.

.LCPI24_0:
	.byte	0
	.byte	1
	.byte	2
	.byte	3
	.byte	4
	.byte	5
	.byte	6
	.byte	7
	.byte	8
	.byte	9
	.byte	10
	.byte	11
	.byte	12
	.byte	13
	.byte	14
	.byte	15

This is amazing optimization.  With a little more hint, it should be
able to get rid of the move.

Decide to rewrite out a deck object, with variant forms.
Start coding.  Improve a bunch of names.
Use lots of lazy static, whenever possible.

Have to stop.  Half complete.

Learning to look at assembly language
follow advice on web.

      RUSTFLAGS="--emit asm" cargo bench --bench foo

      cargo asm --asm-style=intel \
         --rust equart::quadtree::Boundry::subarea

      cargo asm --rust crate::klondike_suits

Could not find any relevant output in release mode.
But this gave some results.  Strange looking assembly.

      RUSTFLAGS="--emit asm" cargo clean
      RUSTFLAGS="--emit asm" cargo build

In the debug directory found this searching for klondike.

                .section	.text._ZN9solitaire14klondike_suits17h318c732eb4fa0095E,"ax",@progbits
                .p2align	4, 0x90
                .type	_ZN9solitaire14klondike_suits17h318c732eb4fa0095E,@function
              _ZN9solitaire14klondike_suits17h318c732eb4fa0095E:
              .Lfunc_begin247:
                .loc	1 155 0
                .cfi_startproc
                .loc	1 161 2 prologue_end
                leaq	_ZN9solitaire14klondike_suits2KS17he916c8a044ee2a49E(%rip), %rax
                retq
              .Ltmp2569:
              .Lfunc_end247:
                .size	_ZN9solitaire14klondike_suits17h318c732eb4fa0095E, .Lfunc_end247-_ZN9solitaire14klondike_suits17h318c732eb4fa0095E
                .cfi_endproc

So it appears, indeed, that the function was optimized away into a
table built at compile time.  I wonder how complicated the code can get and
still run at compile time.  At run time it is merely a single load
effective address instruction and return.

In the release version, this function goes away completely and it is inlined.
Got to be a better way to find the code and read it.

I timed the shuffle test.  User time is:   2m38.310s
1e7 calls to shuffle and to get random bits
ghci> ((2*60)+38.31)/1e7
1.5831e-5

That is surprisingly fast.
About 16 microseconds per iteration.  And each iteration
handles 52 items.  How can it be that fast?
At 2GHZ that is 32k cycles.  That is the top down.
Bottom up guess, (52*2*10) 1040 instructions
That leaves in middle 32 clocks per instruction.
Seem high.  Perhaps more like 4 to 10.

Wonder if the bulk is in random number generation or in the shuffle.
Investigate if possible to get a vector of numbers in a single call
to random number generator.

Coded a test function for shuffle.  Made a deck in sequence, ordinals.
Shuffled 10 times.  Inserted into a hash table.  Repeat a million
times. Ran several times.  No duplicates found. Look at some of
shuffles.  Looks normal.  So this looks like a good shuffle function.

Found that if you want to see console output of successful tests, then
you must add this flag.  I think that the console output of failing
tests is displayed. I guess normally you don't care about output from
passing tests, and there are probably a lot of tests, and it would get
cluttered.

    cargo test -- --nocapture
